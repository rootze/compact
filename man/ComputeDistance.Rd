\usage{
ComputeDistance(
  seurat_object,
  groupby,
  reduction,
  method = c("edist", "euclidean", "spearman"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_object}{A \code{Seurat} object.}

\item{groupby}{A character scalar giving the name of a metadata column in
\code{seurat_object@meta.data} that defines group labels.}

\item{reduction}{A character scalar giving the name of a dimensional reduction
(e.g., \code{"pca"}, \code{"harmony"}) used for distance calculations.}

\item{method}{A character scalar specifying the distance metric to use.
Supported options are \code{"euclidean"}, \code{"edist"} (Energy distance),
and \code{"spearman"}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints progress messages.}
}
\value{
A symmetric \code{data.frame} (groups \eqn{\times} groups) containing
pairwise distances between groups.
}
\description{
Computes pairwise distances between groups (cell states) in a Seurat object
using one of several distance metrics.
}
\details{
Groups are defined by \code{groupby}. Distances are computed in a specified
low-dimensional representation (\code{reduction}) that preserves meaningful
transcriptional geometry (e.g., PCA or Harmony). Depending on \code{method},
distances are computed between group centroids (Euclidean, Spearman) or between
full cell distributions (Energy distance).

Visualization-oriented nonlinear embeddings (e.g., UMAP or t-SNE) are not
recommended for distance-based calculations.

\examples{
# Euclidean distance between group centroids
ComputeDistance(seurat_object, groupby = "Diagnosis",
                reduction = "pca", method = "euclidean")

# Energy distance between group distributions
ComputeDistance(seurat_object, groupby = "Diagnosis",
                reduction = "pca", method = "edist")

# Spearman distance between group centroids
ComputeDistance(seurat_object, groupby = "Diagnosis",
                reduction = "pca", method = "spearman")

\title{Filter gene sets to genes present in a Seurat object}
\usage{
.filter_gene_sets_for_obj(gs_list, seu_obj, min_genes = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{gs_list}{Named list of character vectors, each one a gene set.}

\item{seu_obj}{A Seurat object.}

\item{min_genes}{Minimum number of genes required to retain a gene set
after intersecting with \code{rownames(seu_obj)}.}
}
\value{
A filtered named list of gene sets, containing only genes present
in \code{seu_obj} and with at least \code{min_genes} genes.
}
\description{
This internal helper takes a list of gene sets and restricts each set
to features present in the provided Seurat object. Gene sets with fewer
than \code{min_genes} genes after filtering are dropped.

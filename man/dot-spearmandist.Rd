\usage{
.spearmandist(seurat_object, groupby, reduction, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_object}{A \code{Seurat} object.}

\item{groupby}{A character scalar giving the name of a metadata column in
\code{seurat_object@meta.data} that defines group labels.}

\item{reduction}{A character scalar giving the name of a dimensional reduction
(e.g., \code{"pca"}, \code{"harmony"}) used for distance calculations. This should be
a geometry-preserving representation; visualization-oriented nonlinear embeddings
(e.g., \code{"umap"}, \code{"tsne"}) are not recommended for distance computation.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints progress messages.}
}
\value{
A symmetric \code{data.frame} (groups \eqn{\times} groups) containing
pairwise Spearman distances between group centroids.
}
\description{
Computes pairwise Spearman distances between group centroids (mean embedding vectors)
in a Seurat object.
}
\details{
Cells are grouped according to \code{groupby}. For each group, a centroid is computed
as the column-wise mean of cell embeddings in the specified \code{reduction} space.
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is then computed between all pairs of group
centroids and converted to a distance measure as \eqn{1 - \rho}.

This metric captures monotonic similarity between group-level expression profiles and
is insensitive to absolute scale, but does not account for within-group heterogeneity
or higher-order distributional differences.

\title{This function is used internally to extract the upper triangle of a matrix.
It replaces the lower triangle of the input matrix with \code{NA}, which is useful
when working with symmetrical matrices such as distance or correlation matrices
where only the upper triangle is needed.}
\usage{
.get_upper_tri(cormat)
}
\arguments{
\item{cormat}{A numeric matrix (e.g., a correlation or distance matrix).}
}
\value{
A matrix with \code{NA} values in the lower triangle.
}
